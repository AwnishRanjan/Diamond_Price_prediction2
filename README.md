# DIAMOND PRICE PREDICTION
 

## ABOUT 

 This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various features like carat, depth, table, dimensions (x, y, z), cut, color, and clarity.The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diamond prices using a provided dataset.

## Project Structure

```
src: Contains the source code of the project.
pipelines : Scripts for data transformation, training, and prediction.
components : Modules for data transformation, model training, and prediction.
utils : Utility functions used across the project.
logger : Logging configuration and setup.
exception : Custom exception classes.
artifacts : Directory for storing model files and other outputs.
data: Raw and processed datasets.

```

## Models
```The trained machine learning model is saved in the artifacts/ directory.
Trained Model: artifacts/model.pkl
```

## PREDICTION
```
The prediction pipeline uses the trained model for making predictions.
Prediction Pipeline Script: src/pipelines/prediction_pipeline.py
```
## AUTOMATION 
```
1. Data Transformation Automation:
Create a script within the pipelines/components/ directory for 
automating the transformation of raw data.Schedule this script
to run at specified intervals using task scheduling tools like
cron.
2. Training Pipeline Automation:
Develop a script in pipelines/training_pipeline.py that automates the training process using machine learning algorithms.
Implement Continuous Integration (CI) to trigger the training pipeline whenever there are changes to the training script or data.

3. Prediction Pipeline Automation:
Create a script in pipelines/prediction_pipeline.py that automates the prediction process using the trained model.
4. Model Versioning:
 Automate the process of saving and tracking different versions of your models in the artifacts/ directory.

5.Logging and Monitoring Automation:
Integrate logging into your scripts using the utilities in the logger/ directory for better tracking and debugging.
Use monitoring tools to set up automated alerts for potential issues in data transformation, training, or prediction processes.
