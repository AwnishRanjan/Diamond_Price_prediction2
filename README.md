# Diamond Price Prediction

## About

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various features like carat, depth, table, dimensions (x, y, z), cut, color, and clarity. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diamond prices using a provided dataset.

## Models

The trained machine learning model is saved in the `artifacts/` directory.

Trained Model: `artifacts/model.pkl`

## Prediction

The prediction pipeline uses the trained model for making predictions.

Prediction Pipeline Script: `src/pipelines/prediction_pipeline.py`

## Automation

1. **Data Transformation Automation**:
   Create a script within the `pipelines/components/` directory for automating the transformation of raw data. Schedule this script to run at specified intervals using task scheduling tools like cron.

2. **Training Pipeline Automation**:
   Develop a script in `pipelines/training_pipeline.py` that automates the training process using machine learning algorithms. Implement Continuous Integration (CI) to trigger the training pipeline whenever there are changes to the training script or data.

3. **Prediction Pipeline Automation**:
   Create a script in `pipelines/prediction_pipeline.py` that automates the prediction process using the trained model.

4. **Model Versioning**:
   Automate the process of saving and tracking different versions of your models in the `artifacts/` directory.

5. **Logging and Monitoring Automation**:
   Integrate logging into your scripts using the utilities in the `logger/` directory for better tracking and debugging. Use monitoring tools to set up automated alerts for potential issues in data transformation, training, or prediction processes.
