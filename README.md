Diamond Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on various features like carat, depth, table,
dimensions (x, y, z), cut, color, and clarity.The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately
predicts diamond prices using a provided dataset.

Models
The trained machine learning model is saved in the artifacts/ directory.

Trained Model: artifacts/model.pkl
Training
The training pipeline processes raw data, transforms it, and trains machine learning models.

Training Pipeline Script: src/pipelines/training_pipeline.py
Prediction
The prediction pipeline uses the trained model for making predictions.
